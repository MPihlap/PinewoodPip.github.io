#### A resource pack for Minecraft 1.13+ which reskins some of the UI to be styled after Windows 10.

For the past 3 years we've been doing yearly playthroughs of Minecraft in the summer breaks. To spice it up we prepare a custom resource pack each year filled with memes and in-jokes, and this interface reskin was part of 2019's pack. I feel it's pretty nice to use by itself, so I decided to release it for anyone to use.

It changes the hotbar, inventory, chest interfaces, some strings and a few other minor things. It also reskins one of the flowers into the VLC Media Player icon, and acacia signs turn into a pixelized depiction of Notepad++.

The textures were made in [Aseprite.](https://www.aseprite.org/) It's one of the best spriting programs I've used and I highly recommend it!
