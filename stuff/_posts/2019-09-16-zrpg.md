#### The Siege of Kaerwood is our second game; a 2D top-down action roguelike inspired by Zelda and Wayward Souls. It features multiple weapons with different playstyles, dual wielding, and exotic spells for each weapon.

The current version is very short, as there is only one level. "ZRPG" is just the codename; when the version you can download here was built we didn't have a logo or final name for it yet.

It's currently on hold as we're working on the Awesome soccer web port and our website, but we will get back to it soonâ„¢. The next update will have multiple levels/floors which should give a better feel for how the equipment system will work.
