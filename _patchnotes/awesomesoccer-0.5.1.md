title: The Items Update
short-desc: Adds consumable items.
version: v0.5.1
date: 2020-04-13
---

- Added 3 consumable items, which drop from enemies: water bottle, towel, pepper spray
- Consumable items can also be used out-of-combat from your wardrobe (only the ones that make sense)
- Added a new perk, "The Art of The Steal", which increases your chances to find consumables

Fixes:
- Fixed the goalkeeper enemy not spawning in Stadium
- Fixed an oversight in the loading routine
- Fixed Monocles of Duality being always active (again)
- Fixed a crash on winning combat with a weapon strike (but the "You win!" text still displays twice)
